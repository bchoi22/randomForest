# randomForest

Using decision trees - Random Forest to evaluate and predict the correct level of wine quality using the wine's inherent features.  Data is from https://www.kaggle.com/maitree/wine-quality-selection

Methodology includes concepts of ordinal data and why decision trees would work relatively well for that.  I evaluate effects of feature dimension reduction (Principle Component Analysis - PCA), neural network performance, and k-cross validation techniques and how that affects the model's predictability.
